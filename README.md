# 👋 Hi there! I’m Mario Ferrera.

- 🛣️ From the beginning of my development journey, I've enjoyed building software and systems that allow me to think logically and creatively. Fast forward many years later and now I work with all kinds of technologies, concepts, and tools to build software with purpose; all while enjoying the thrill of tackling whatever computer science throws at me.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for full stack or backend roles where I can exercise my aptitude and love for logical problem-solving. I'd especially like to work on a team where I can strongly impact the development, design, and testing of great software — ideally using the MERN stack or Python. If you're hiring, I'd love to have a chat!

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
