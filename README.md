# 👋 Hi there! I’m Mario Ferrera. A Software Developer and technical support professional.

- 🛣️ I discovered my love for development back in high school where I built my first website from scratch using classic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I've enjoyed getting my hands dirty with tech and engaging in the puzzle-solving exercise of writing code. Fast forward many years later and I've now worked with different kinds of technologies, programming concepts, and developer tools to build software with a purpose; all while enjoying the thrill of tackling whatever new challenge presents itself.

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
