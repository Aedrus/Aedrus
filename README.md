# 👋 Hi there! I’m Mario Ferrera.

- 🛣️ I discovered my love for development back in high school where I built my first website from scratch using classic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I've enjoyed getting my hands dirty with tech and engaging in the puzzle-solving exercise of writing code. Fast forward many years later and I've now worked with different kinds of technologies, programming concepts, and developer tools to build software with a purpose; all while enjoying the thrill of tackling whatever new challenge presents itself.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for full stack or backend roles where I can exercise my aptitude and love for logical problem-solving and project building. I'd especially like to work on a team where I can strongly impact the internal development, design, and testing of software — ideally using the MERN stack or Python. If you're hiring, I'd love to have a chat!

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
