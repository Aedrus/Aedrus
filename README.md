- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Mario Ferrera, also known by my alias Aedrus (pronounced ay-druh-s).

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Software Developer/Designer building clean and scalable websites centered around an exceptionally beneficial user experience. I have experience with the web trifecta (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), the MERN Stack, and a whole load of computer science theories and programming principles. If I had to distill my personality and strengths into one sentence it would be the following: I like to solve problems using my curiosity and love for technology.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about new theories, systems, algorithms, and the connection between technology and humans. These include new languages, AI tools, frontend libraries, and how to write better code. My current favorite topic is Fullstack Development and how to build user-centered, all-encompassing software from ideation to development. Some of my passions are music, calisthenics, gaming, and creative writing.

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
