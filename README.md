- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Mario Ferrera, also known by my alias @Aedrus.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Front-End Developer/Designer working to build clean and optimized websites centered around an exceptionally beneficial user experience. Some of my passions are metal music, calisthenics, gaming, and creative writing on a rainy day. I also enjoy long walks both on and off the beach.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about new territories and advanced techniques. This includes the various languages, CMS, libraries, and frameworks that are plentiful across the internet. My current favorite study topics are AI tools like chatGPT and Sketch2Code.

Take Care!
