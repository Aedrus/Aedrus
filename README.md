# 👋 Hi there! I’m Mario Ferrera.

- 🛣️ From the start of my development journey—building websites in high school using classic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—I've enjoyed getting my hands dirty with tech and developing solutions with a puzzle solver's intrigue. Fast forward many years later and now I've worked with different kinds of technologies, concepts, and tools to build software with purpose; all while enjoying the thrill of tackling whatever new challenge presents itself.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking for full stack or backend roles where I can exercise my aptitude and love for logical problem-solving. I'd especially like to work on a team where I can strongly impact the development, design, and testing of great software — ideally using the MERN stack or Python. If you're hiring, I'd love to have a chat!

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
