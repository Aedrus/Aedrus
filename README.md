- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Mario Ferrera, also known by my alias Aedrus.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Front-End Developer/Designer working to build clean and optimized websites centered around an exceptionally beneficial user experience. Some of my passions are metal music, calisthenics, gaming, and creative writing. In many ways I am guided by passions and my innate desire for knowledge. I also enjoy long walks both on and off the beach.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about new theories, systems, algorithms, and the connection between technology and humans. This includes various languages, CMS, libraries, and frameworks that are plentiful across the internet. My current favorite topic is AI tools like chatGPT.

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
