# 👋 Hi there! I’m Mario Ferrera.

- 🛣️ My development journey took root back in high school where I created my first website in a basic web design elective. Fast forward many years later and now I work with all kinds of technologies, concepts, and tools to build software with a purpose; all while enjoying the thrill of tackling whatever computer science throws at me.

- 🌱 I’m currently on the lookout for full stack or backend development roles where I can exercise my aptitude for logical problem solving. I'd especially love to work on a team where I can make a strong impact on the development, design, and testing of great software — ideally using the MERN stack or Python. If you're hiring, I'd love to have a chat!

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
