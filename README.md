- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Mario Ferrera, also known by my alias Aedrus (pronounced ay-druh-s).

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a Software Developer/Designer building clean and scalable websites centered around an exceptionally beneficial user experience. I have experience with the web trifecta (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), the MERN Stack, and a whole load of computer science theories and programming principles. If I had to distill my personality and strengths into one sentence it would be the following: I like to solve problems using my curiosity and love for technology.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software architecture methodologies, Rust, clean code best practices, and a little bit of clean database management with SQL. Some of my other passions include music, fitness, gaming, and creative writing.

Thanks for stopping by and take care out there!
